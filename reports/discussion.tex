\section{Discussion}

We set out to understand how a scientist can ethically subset their dataset to maximize the stastical power of the Cox proportional hazards model. We designed our experiments to understand how different design elements affect a study's power. 

We close with three findings:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reducing the observation period adds comparatively little power to the study.
    \item Short studies of several patients are more powerful than longer studies with fewer patients. 
    \item The final 20\% of cohorts present very little value to the statistical power of the study. 
\end{enumerate}
%
With these results, we recommend studies divert resources to short studies of several patients where possible. Researchers can further reduce cost by closing enrollment for the final 20\% of observation periods. 

\subsection{Next Steps}

We present recommendations for future researchers interested in reproducing and expanding on our work. The most immediate improvements can be made by defining new features and fitting new models on these features. In the absence of a theoretically derived power calculation, a reliable predictive model may be employed with sufficient data and model design. Such a predictive model could inform scientists globally and reduce the cost of research. Finally, we'd like to see our findings applied to different survival models, such as the accelerated failure time model, to compare and contrast results.
