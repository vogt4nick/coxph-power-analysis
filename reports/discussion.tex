\section{Discussion}

There will be a lot to discuss when it's done. 

I think this was useful to understand which predictors have the greatest effect on power, but I distrust the predictions because the dataset parameters covered only a small area of the total sample space.

\subsection{Next Steps}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply to Accelerated Failure Time model; compare results. 
    \item Find better features.
    \item Define the mathematics for power testing.
    \item Our models were designed with inference, not prediction, in mind. How might a prediction model change things?
\end{itemize}
