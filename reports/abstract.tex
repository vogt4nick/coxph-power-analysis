The Cox proportional hazards model is a core component of several experimental designs in medicine and beyond. These experimental results impact the lives of millions of patients globally and billions of dollars in investment. Little is understood, however, regarding which design elements most contribute to a design's success or failure; i.e. the study's statistical power. Scientists can design more effective and cost-effective studies by understanding which design elements impact statistical power. We design an experiment to answer this question by simulating survival datasets, fitting several Cox proportional hazards models, and analyzing the results. Most notably, we find that short studies of several patients are more powerful than longer studies with fewer patients.
