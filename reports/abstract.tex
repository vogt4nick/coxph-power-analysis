\begin{abstract}
This here is the best abstract ever written. It's clear, concise, and sets expectations with minimal fanfare. You put the problem in context. You briefly explain why the problem exists. Again, briefly explain what you're gonna do to solve the problem. Then you take a few lines explain your results and why they're important. How should one honestly and ethically subset their dataset to maximize the power of the Cox proportional hazards model?
